// Backup of App.tsx content...
// (I am overwriting the file, so I need to be careful. Actually, I should use replace_file_content to comment it out, not overwrite entire file to be safe.)
// But to be minimal, I need to comment out imports too.
// I'll just write a minimal App.tsx and backup the original first by reading it.
